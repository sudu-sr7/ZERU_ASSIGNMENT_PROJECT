## Score Distribution

The distribution of credit scores across the analyzed wallets provides a clear overview of the user base's risk profile. The scores are bucketed into ranges from 0 to 1000.

### Score Range Breakdown:

* **800 - 1000 (Prime Plus)**: Top-tier, highly reliable wallets. Excellent history, high liquidity, and responsible borrowing.
* **600 - 799 (Prime)**: Reliable, low-risk wallets. Good history and consistent repayment behavior.
* **400 - 599 (Near Prime)**: Average wallets. May have shorter histories or moderate LTV ratios but no major negative events.
* **200 - 399 (Subprime)**: Higher-risk wallets. Often characterized by high LTV ratios, short histories, or low activity.
* **0 - 199 (High Risk)**: The riskiest wallets. These accounts have typically experienced one or more liquidations.

## Behavior of Wallets in the Lower Range (0-399)

Wallets with lower scores tend to exhibit high-risk on-chain behavior. Common characteristics include:

* **Aggressive Leverage**: Borrowing amounts very close to their collateral value, leading to high LTV ratios and a high risk of liquidation.
* **Liquidation History**: The most significant factor for a low score. A past liquidation is a strong signal of unsustainable debt management.
* **Short or Erratic History**: Wallets that are very new or have long periods of inactivity mixed with sudden, high-risk trades.
* **Potential Bot Activity**: Some low-scoring wallets show signs of automated trading, with many transactions fired in rapid succession, which can be linked to high-risk arbitrage strategies.

## Behavior of Wallets in the Higher Range (600-1000)

Wallets in the top tiers are considered the most creditworthy and responsible protocol users. Their behavior is defined by:

* **Longevity and Consistency**: These wallets have a long and active transaction history on the protocol.
* **Conservative Borrowing**: They maintain a low and healthy LTV ratio, often depositing far more than they borrow.
* **Reliable Repayments**: A proven track record of repaying all borrowed funds.
* **Significant Liquidity Provision**: High-scoring wallets are often major liquidity providers, contributing positively to the protocol's health.
